# Object Projector  

A simple algorithm that reads a `.obj` file, extracts its 3D geometric data, and projects it onto a 2D Cartesian plane for visualization.  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.  

## Setup  
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-projector.git
cd object-projector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the program, execute:
```sh
python3 src/main.py
```

## Input
- The program reads a `.obj` file containing 3D geometric data.
- Ensure the file is correctly formatted and placed inside the `models/` directory.
- If needed, update the file path in `src/main.py`.
